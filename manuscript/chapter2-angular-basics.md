# Angular Basics

This chapter will walk you through the basics of Angular2. We will start by looking at the basics of components, and then we move onto pipes, events and other concepts. By the end of the chapter you should have a basic understanding of the new concepts in Angular2.

The goal of this chapter is to get your feet wet without scaring you with a lot of details. Don't worry, there will be a lot coming in the later chapters.

## Components

Components are at the heart of Angular. The main idea is that you break down your application into different cohesive components and let the components handle the rest. Every component has a controller defined by a class and a template defined by html. In addition, a component's job is to enable the user experience and delegate everything non-trivial to services.

In this section we are going to write a simple `HelloAngular` component, compile it and run it in the browser. In addition, we will configure VSCode to build the TypeScript files as we go.

Note that there is a lot to talk about components. We are going dive into components a lot more in later chapters, but for now let's just keep things simple.

### Project Files

The project files for this chapter are in **[`angular2-intro/project-files/basic-component`](https://github.com/st32lth/angular2-intro/tree/master/project-files/basic-component)**

You can either follow along or just look at the final result. As always, the `node_modules` folder is not included. You would have to install it with `npm i` in the project folder:

    cd angular2-intro/project-files/basic-component && npm i

### Getting Started

Make a folder on your desktop called `hello-angular` and navigate to it:

```bash
mkdir ~/Desktop/hello-angular && cd $_
```

Start npm in this folder with `npm init` and accept all the defaults.

After that, install the dependencies with:

```bash
npm i angular2 rxjs -S
```

Then install the "devDependencies":

```bash
npm i systemjs -D
```

After all the dependencies are installed, start VSCode in this folder with `code .`

Then create a `index.html` file in the root of the project and put in the following:

**`index.html`**

```html
<html>
<head>
  <title>Hello Angular</title>

  <script src="/node_modules/angular2/bundles/angular2-polyfills.js"></script>
  <script src="/node_modules/systemjs/dist/system.src.js"></script>
  <script src="/node_modules/rxjs/bundles/Rx.js"></script>
  <script src="/node_modules/angular2/bundles/angular2.dev.js"></script>

  <!-- add systemjs settings later -->

</head>

<body>
  <!-- add app stuff later -->
</body>

</html>
```

This loads all the necessary scripts that we need to run Angular in the browser.

**Note**

If you need to support older browsers, you need to include the `es6-shims` before everything else:

```html
<script src="/node_modules/es6-shim/es6-shim.js"></script>
```

### Making the Component

Let's start by making the `main.ts` file in the root of the project. In this file we are going to define the main component called `HelloAngular` and then bootstrap the app with it:

**`main.ts`**

```typescript
import {Component, OnInit } from 'angular2/core';
import {bootstrap} from 'angular2/platform/browser';

@Component({
  selector: 'app',
  template: `<h1> hello angular </h1> `
});

class HelloAngular implements OnInit  {
  constructor() { console.log('constructor called'); }
  ngOnInit() { console.log('component initialized'); }
}

bootstrap(HelloAngular, []);
```

- On line 1 we are importing the `component` meta data (annotation) and the `onInit` interface.
- On line 2 we are loading the `bootstrap` method that bootstraps the app given a component.
- On line 4, we are defining a component using the `component` annotation. The `@component` is technically a class decorator because it precedes the `HelloAngular` class definition.
- On line 5, we are telling angular to look out for the `app` tag. So when Angular looks at the html and comes across the `<app></app>` tag, it is going to load the template (on line 6) and instantiates the class for it (defined on line 9).
- On line 9, we are defining a class called `HelloAngular` that defines the logic of the component. And for fun, we are implementing the `OnInit` interface to log something to the console when the component is ready with its data. We will learn more about the lifeCycle hooks later.
- Last but not least, we call the `bootstrap` method with the `HelloAngular` class as the first argument to bootstrap the app with the `HelloAngular` component.

### Compiling the Component

Now we need to compile the file to JavaScript. We can do it from the terminal, but let's stick to VSCode. In order to that, we need to make two config files:

1. First is the standard [`tsconfig.json`](http://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig) file

2. And the `tasks.json` file for VSCode to do the compiling

Create the `tsconfig.json` file in the root of the project and put in the following:

**`tsconfig.json`**

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "module": "system",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "noImplicitAny": false,
    "outDir": "output",
    "watch": true
  },
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules"
  ]
}
```

Then create the `tasks.json` in the `.vscode` folder in the root of the project and put in the following:

**`.vscode/tasks.json`**

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "command": "tsc",
  "showOutput": "silent",
  "isShellCommand": true,
  "problemMatcher": "$tsc"
}
```

- Now we can build the TypeScript files as we work. We just need to start the build task with `command + shift + b` or using the prompt. If you want to use the prompt do the following:

    - Use `command + shift + p` to open the prompt

    - Then, type `> run build task` and hit enter to start the build task.

- After you run the build task, you should see an `output` file generated with `main.js` and the source maps in it.

- The task is watching the files and compiling as you go. To stop the task, open the prompt and type:

    ```
    > terminate running task
    ```

### Loading the Component

After compiling the component, we need to load it to the `index.html` file with `Systemjs`. Open the `index.html` file and replace `<!-- add systemjs settings later -->` with the following:

```html
<script>
  System.config({
    packages: {
      output: {
        format: 'register',
        defaultExtension: 'js'
      }
    }
  });
  System.import('output/main')
  .then(null, console.error.bind(console));
</script>
```

Now we can use our component in the body of the html:

```html
<body>
  <app>Loading ...</app>
</body>
```

It is finally time to serve the app. You can serve the app in the current directory using the `live-server`:

```bash
live-server .
```

If everything is wired up correctly, you should be able to see the following:

## Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection is a coding pattern in which a class receives its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself. In order to achieve Dependency Injection we need a Dependency InjectionFramework to handle the dependencies for us. Using a DI framework, you simply ask for a class from the injector instead of worrying about the dependencies inside the class itself.

Angular has a standalone module that handles Dependency Injection. This framework can also be used in non-Angular applications to handle Dependency Injection.
## Services and Providers

- A service is nothing more than a class in Angular 2. It remains nothing more than a class until we register it with the Angular injector.
- When you bootstrap your app, Angular creates an injector on the fly that can inject services and other dependencies throughout the app.
- You can register the service or the dependencies during when bootstrapping the app or when defining a component.
- If you have a class called `MyService`, you can register it with the Injector and then you can inject it everywhere:

    ```typescript
    bootstrap(App, [MyService]); // second param is an array of providers
    ```
- Providers is a way to specify what services are available inside the component in a hierarchical fashion.
- A provider can be a class, a value or a factory.
- Providers create the instances of the things that we ask the injector to inject.
- `[SomeService];` is short for `[provide(SomeService, {useClass:SomeService})];` where the first param is the token, and the second is the definition object.
- A simple object can be passed to the Injector to create a Value Provider:

    ```typescript
    beforeEachProviders(() => {
      let someService = { getData: () => [] };
      // using `useValue` instead of `useClass`
      return [ provide(SomeSvc, {useValue: someService}) ];
    });
    ```
- You can also use a factory as a provider.
- You can use a factory function that creates a properly configured Service:

    ```typescript
    let myServiceFactory = (dx: DepX, dy: DepY) => {
      return new MyService(dx, dy.value);
    }

    // provider definition object.
    let myServiceDefinition = {
       useFactory: myServiceFactory,
       deps: [DepX, DepY]
    };

    // create provider and bootstrap
    let myServiceProvider = provide(MyService, myServiceDefinition);
    bootstrap(AppComponent, [myServiceProvider, DepX, DepY]);
    ```

- Defining object dependencies is simple. You can make a plain JavaScript object available for injection using a string-based token and the `@Inject` decorator:

    ```typescript
    var myObj = {};

    bootstrap(AppComponent, [
      provide('coolObjToken', {useValue: myObj})
    ]);

    // and you can inject it to a component

    import {Inject} from 'angular2/core'
    constructor(dx: DepX, @Inject('coolObjToken') config)
    ```
