Installing Node
===============

-   Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install and manage
    Node on the machine. Copy the install script and run it:

``` {.bash}
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.30.1/install.sh | bash
```

-   After installed, make sure that it is installed, by running:

``` {.bash}
nvm --help
```

-   Then use `nvm` to install node version `0.12.9` by running:

``` {.bash}
nvm install 0.12.9
```

-   Confirm that it is installed by running `node -v`.

-   You can load any node version in the current shell with
    `nvm use 0.x.y` after of course installing it.

-   You can make `0.12.9` the default version by making an alias for the
    default node:

    ``` {.bash}
    nvm alias default 0.12.9
    ```

    Permissions
    -----------

-   Never use `sudo` to install packages, never do
    `sudo npm install <package>`. If you get permission errors, you can
    own the folders by the current user. So for example, if you get an
    error like:

    ``` {.bash}
    Error: EACCES, mkdir '/usr/local'
    ```

-   you can own the folder with:

    ``` {.bash}
    sudo chown -R `whoami` /usr/local
    ```

    You can own folders until node doesn't complain.
