<h2 id="data-architecture">Data Architecture</h2>
<ul>
<li>Angular is flexible and doesn't prescribe a recipe for managing data in your apps</li>
<li>Since observables are integrated into Angular, you can take advantage of observables to manage data and state</li>
<li>You ca use services to manage streams that emit models</li>
<li>Components can subscribe to the streams maintained by services and render accordingly.
<ul>
<li>For example, you can have a service for a Todo app that contains a stream of todos and a <code>ListComponent</code> can listen for todos and render when a new task is added.</li>
<li>You may have another component that listens for the user that has been assigned to a task provided by a service.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The steps for creating different parts of an app can be summarized in three steps:
<ul>
<li>Defining a Model using a class</li>
<li>Defining the service</li>
<li>Defining the component</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
