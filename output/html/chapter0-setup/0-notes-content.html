<ul>
<li><p>The book assumes that you are working in a Unix-like environment. If you are on Windows you can use <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> so that you can follow along with the bash terminal commands.</p></li>
<li><p>All the project files for the book are hosted on github: <a href="https://github.com/st32lth/angular2-intro" class="uri">https://github.com/st32lth/angular2-intro</a>. You can clone the repository and check out the project files. Throughout the book, you will see references to the project files. Those refer to this repository. For example, <code>angular2-intro/project-files/hello-angular</code> refers to the <code>hello-angular</code> folder inside the <code>project-files</code> folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you have <code>git</code> installed on your machine. That is, make sure you get an output for <code>git --version</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The book assumes that you have a working knowledge of JavaScript and Angular 1.x</p></li>
<li><p>Node is heavily used throughout the book. Make sure that you follow the &quot;Node&quot; chapter to install Node and set permissions correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>All the keyboard shortcuts are mac-based. But if you are using a non-mac machine, you can almost always replace <code>command</code> with <code>ctrl</code> and you should be good. For example, if you a see a shortcut like <code>command + shift + b</code>, you can use <code>ctrl + shift + b</code> where <code>ctrl</code> is obviously the <code>control</code> key.</p></li>
