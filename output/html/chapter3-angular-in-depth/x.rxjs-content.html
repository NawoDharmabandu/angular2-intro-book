<h1 id="rxjs">RxJS</h1>
<ul>
<li>RxJS is a library for reactive programming</li>
<li>Reactive programming is a natural way of thinking about asynchronous code which concerns itself with operations on event streams</li>
<li>RxJS is used in this paradigm to compose asynchronous data/event streams</li>
<li>Using the reactive paradigm, you can perform operations on streams using a consistent interface regardless of the data source</li>
<li>Streams of events/data are known as Observables, i.e. a data/event stream = observable</li>
<li>A program can be just composed of different data streams (observables)</li>
