# Angular Basics

This chapter will walk you through the basics of Angular2. We will start by looking at the basics of components, and then we move onto pipes, events and other concepts. By the end of the chapter you should have a basic understanding of the new concepts in Angular2.

The goal of this chapter is to get your feet wet without scaring you with a lot of details. Don't worry, there will be a lot coming in the later chapters.

## Using Angular Project Files

In order to run the project files, you need to do two things:

- First, install the server dependencies and run the server in the root of the code repo:

    ```
    npm i && npm start
    ```

    After the dependencies are installed, it will open up the browser at port 8080.

- The next step is to install the dependencies for angular examples. Go to `project-files/angular-examples` and install the dependencies:

    ```
    cd project-files/angular-examples && npm i
    ```

After following the steps above, you should be able to see the examples in the browser. For example, if you want to see the `basic-component` example, you can go to the following url:

```
http://localhost:8080/project-files/angular-examples/basic-component/index.html
```
