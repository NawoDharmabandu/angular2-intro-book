## Directives

- Directives and components hand-in-hand are the fundamental building blocks of any Angular app
- Directives are components without templates. Conversely, components are directives without templates
- Directives allow you to attach behavior to elements in the DOM
- A directive is defined using the `@directive` decorator
- There are two types of directives in Angular:
    - Structural
    - Attribute
- The `selector` attribute uses a css selector to find the element. However, parent-child relationship selectors are not supported
- You can use the following possible selectors:
    - `element`
    - `[attribute]`
    - `.classname`
    - `:not()`
    - `.some-class:not(div)`

### Built-in Directives

Angular has a couple of useful built-in directives.

**TODO**(Note on directive names, docs and template usage)

#### `NgClass`

- `import {NgClass} from 'angular2/common';`, `directives: [NgClass]`
- Template Usage: `<div class="button" [ngClass]="{active: isActive, disabled: !isActive}"`
**Note** that we are using `ngClass` in the template, but not `NgClass`

#### `NgIf`

**TODO**

#### `NgSwitch`

**TODO**

#### `NgFor`

- Usage: `<ul> <li *ngFor="#item of items"> ... </li> </ul>`
