## Directives

- Directives and components hand-in-hand are the fundamental building blocks of any Angular app
- Directives are components without templates. Conversely, components are directives without templates
- Directives allow you to attach behavior to elements in the DOM
- A directive is defined using the `@directive` decorator
- There are three types of directives in Angular:
    - Structural
    - Attribute
    - Components
- Evey directive metadata, has the following options:
    - selector
    - host
    - ...
- The `selector` attribute uses a css selector to find the element. However, parent-child relationship selectors are not supported
- You can use the following possible selectors:
    - `element`
    - `[attribute]`
    - `.classname`
    - `:not()`
    - `.some-class:not(div)`
- The `host` option defines:
    - Property bindings
    - Event handlers
    - attributes

**TODO**(other decorator options)
