## Services and Providers

- A service is nothing more than a class in Angular 2. It remains nothing more than a class until we register it with the Angular injector.
- When you bootstrap your app, Angular creates an injector on the fly that can inject services and other dependencies throughout the app.
- You can register the service or the dependencies during when bootstrapping the app or when defining a component.
- If you have a class called `MyService`, you can register it with the Injector and then you can inject it everywhere:

    ~~~~{.numberLines .java startFrom="1"}
    bootstrap(App, [MyService]); // second param is an array of providers
    ~~~~~~~
- Providers is a way to specify what services are available inside the component in a hierarchical fashion.
- A provider can be a class, a value or a factory.
- Providers create the instances of the things that we ask the injector to inject.
- `[SomeService];` is short for `[provide(SomeService, {useClass:SomeService})];` where the first param is the token, and the second is the definition object.
- A simple object can be passed to the Injector to create a Value Provider:

    ~~~~{.numberLines .java startFrom="1"}
    beforeEachProviders(() => {
      let someService = { getData: () => [] };
      // using `useValue` instead of `useClass`
      return [ provide(SomeSvc, {useValue: someService}) ];
    });
    ~~~~~~~
- You can also use a factory as a provider.
- You can use a factory function that creates a properly configured Service:

    ~~~~{.numberLines .java startFrom="1"}
    let myServiceFactory = (dx: DepX, dy: DepY) => {
      return new MyService(dx, dy.value);
    }

    // provider definition object.
    let myServiceDefinition = {
       useFactory: myServiceFactory,
       deps: [DepX, DepY]
    };

    // create provider and bootstrap
    let myServiceProvider = provide(MyService, myServiceDefinition);
    bootstrap(AppComponent, [myServiceProvider, DepX, DepY]);
    ~~~~~~~

- Defining object dependencies is simple. You can make a plain JavaScript object available for injection using a string-based token and the `@Inject` decorator:

    ~~~~{.numberLines .java startFrom="1"}
    var myObj = {};

    bootstrap(AppComponent, [
      provide('coolObjToken', {useValue: myObj})
    ]);

    // and you can inject it to a component

    import {Inject} from 'angular2/core'
    constructor(dx: DepX, @Inject('coolObjToken') config)
    ~~~~~~~
