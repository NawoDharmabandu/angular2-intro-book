# RxJS

- RxJS is a library for reactive programming
- Reactive programming is a natural way of thinking about asynchronous code which concerns itself with operations on event streams
- RxJS is used in this paradigm to compose asynchronous data/event streams
- Using the reactive paradigm, you can perform operations on streams using a consistent interface regardless of the data source
- Streams of events/data are known as Observables, i.e. a data/event stream = observable
- A program can be just composed of different data streams (observables)
