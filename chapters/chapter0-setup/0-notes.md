# Notes

- The book assumes that you are working in a Unix-like environment. If you are on Windows you can use [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) so that you can follow along with the bash terminal commands.

- All the project files for the book are hosted on github: [https://github.com/st32lth/angular2-intro](https://github.com/st32lth/angular2-intro). You can clone the repository and check out the project files. Throughout the book, you will see references to the project files. Those refer to this repository. For example, `angular2-intro/project-files/hello-angular` refers to the `hello-angular` folder inside the `project-files` folder.

- Make sure you have `git` installed on your machine. That is, make sure you get an output for `git --version`.

- The book assumes that you have a working knowledge of JavaScript and Angular 1.x

- Node is heavily used throughout the book. Make sure that you follow the "Node" chapter to install Node and set permissions correctly.

- All the keyboard shortcuts are mac-based. But if you are using a non-mac machine, you can almost always replace `command` with `ctrl` and you should be good. For example, if you a see a shortcut like `command + shift + b`, you can use `ctrl + shift + b` where `ctrl` is obviously the `control` key!
