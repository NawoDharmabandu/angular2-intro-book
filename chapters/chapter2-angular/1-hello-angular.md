# Hello Angular

In this section we are going to build a simple Angular component. In addition, we will configure VSCode as well to build TypeScript files for us.

## Getting Started

- Make a folder on your desktop called `hello-angular` and navigate to it:

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/Desktop/hello-angular && cd $_
    ```

- Start npm in this folder with `npm init` and accept all the defaults.

- Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm i packagename -S
    ```

- After all the dependencies are installed, let's started VSCode in this folder with `code .`
