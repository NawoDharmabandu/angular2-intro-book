### Structural Directives

- The Structural directive changes the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements
- Angular has several built-in structural directives, namely `NgIf`, `NgSwitch`, and `NgFor`
- When working with structural directives, we should ask ourselves to think carefully about the consequences of adding and removing elements and of creating and destroying components
- Angular uses the html5 `<template>` tag to add or remove DOM elements
- By default, Angular replaces `<template>` with `<script>` tag if no behavior is attached
- The `*` before a directive name is a shorthand for including the directive content in the `<template>` tag
- Below you can see the built-in `NgIf` directive with and without the asterisks `*`:

**With `*`**

```html
<p *ngIf="condition"></p>
```

**Without `*`**

```html
<template [ngIf]="condition">
  <p></p>
</template>
```

Notice how the `<p>` tag is wrapped with a `<template>` and the condition is bound to the `[ngIf]` property of the directive

**TODO** (writing a custom structural directive)

```typescript
@Directive({
  selector: '[myUnless]'
})
class UnlessDirective {

  constructor(
    private tRef: TemplateRef,
    private vContainer: ViewContainerRef
  ) { }

  @Input() set myUnless(condition: boolean) {
    if (!condition) {
      this.vContainer.createEmbeddedView(this.tRef);
    } else {
      this.vContainer.clear();
    }
  }
}
```

**TemplateRef**: TODO: details

**ViewContainerRef**: TODO: details

**`@Input() set myUnless(condition: boolean) {}`**: TODO: details
