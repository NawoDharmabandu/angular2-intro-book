## Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection is a coding pattern in which a class receives its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself. In order to achieve Dependency Injection we need a Dependency InjectionFramework to handle the dependencies for us. Using a DI framework, you simply ask for a class from the injector instead of worrying about the dependencies inside the class itself.

Angular has a standalone module that handles Dependency Injection. This framework can also be used in non-Angular applications to handle Dependency Injection.
