# TypeScript Crash-course

## Installing TypeScript

You can install the TypeScript compiler with node:

```bash
npm i typescript -g
```

Then to verify that it is installed, run `tsc -v` to see the version of the compiler. You will get an output like this:

```
message TS6029: Version 1.7.5
```

In addition to the compiler, we also need to install the TypeScript Definition manager for DefinitelyTyped (tsd). You can install tsd with:

```bash
npm i tsd -g
```

Using TSD, you can search and install TypeScript definition files directly from the community driven DefinitelyTyped repository. To verify that tsd is installed, run tsd with the `version` flag:

```bash
tsd --version
```

You should get an output like this:

```
>> tsd 0.6.5
```

After `tsd` and `tsc` are installed, we can compile a hello world program:

- make a file called `hello.ts` on your desktop:

    ```bash
    touch ~/Desktop/hello.ts
    ```

- Then, put some TypeScript code in the file:

    ```bash
    echo "const adder = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;" > ~/Desktop/hello.ts
    ```

- Then you can compile the file to JavaScript:

    ```bash
    tsc ~/Desktop/hello.ts
    ```

- It should output a file in `Desktop/hello.js`:

    ```javascript
    var adder = function (a, b) { return a + b; };
    ```

Now that your TypeScript compiler setup, we can move on to configuring Visual Studio Code.

## Setting up TypeScript for VSCode

You can set up Visual Studio Code to compile your TypeScript code as your work.

- First, open Visual Studio Code
- Make a new window: `File > New Window`
- Then, make a folder on your desktop for a new project: `mkdir ~/Desktop/vscode-demo`
- The, open the folder in VSCode: `File > open` and select the `vscode-demo` folder on your desktop.
- Now we need to make three configuration files:

    1. `tsconfig.json`: configuration for the TypeScript compiler
    2. `tasks.json`: Task configuration for VSCode to watch and compile files
    3. `launch.json`: Configuration for the debugger

- The `tsconfig.json` file should be in the root of the project. Let's make the file and put the following in it:

    ```
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "experimentalDecorators": true,
        "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
        "module": "commonjs",
        "target": "es5",
        "sourceMap": true,
        "outDir": "output",
        "watch": true
      }
    }
    ```
- Now to make the `tasks.json` file, open the prompt with `command + shift + p` and type:

    ```
    > configure task runner
    ```

- Then put the following in the file and save the file:

    ```
    {
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "command": "tsc",
      "showOutput": "silent",
      "isShellCommand": true,
      "problemMatcher": "$tsc"
    }
    ```

- The last thing that we need to set up is the debugger, i.e.`launch.json` file. Right click on the `.vscode` folder in the file navigator and make a new file called `launch.json` and put in the following:

    ```
    {
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "configurations": [
        {
          "name": "TS Debugger",
          "type": "node",
          "program": "main.ts",
          "stopOnEntry": false,
          "sourceMaps": true,
          "outDir": "output"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

- After you save the file, you should be able to see the debugger in the debugger dropdown options.

- Now, we are ready to make the `main.ts` file in the root of the project:

    **`main.ts`**

    ```typescript
    console.log('hello');
    ```

- Now you can start the task to watch the files and compile as you work. Open the prompt with `command + shift + p` and type:

    ```
    > run build tasks
    ```

    you can also use the `command + shift + b` keyboard shortcut instead. This will start the debugger and watch the files. After making a change to `main.ts`, you should be able to see the output in the `output` folder.

- Now that the build task is running, we can put a breakpoint anywhere in our typescript code. Lets add some more code to the main file and use the debugger:

    ```typescript
    let a = 2;
    let b = 3;
    let c = 4;
    ```

- Then click on the margin of line two for example to add a breakpoint. Then open the debugger tab to run the debugger and you should see that the program will stop at the breakpoint and you can step over or into the line.

- To stop the task you can terminate it. Open the prompt and type:

    ```
    > terminate running task
    ```
