# Angular Basics

This chapter will walk you through the basics of Angular2. We will start by looking at the basics of components, and then we move onto pipes, events and other concepts. By the end of the chapter you should have a basic understanding of the new concepts in Angular2.

The goal of this chapter is to get your feet wet without scaring you with a lot of details. Don't worry, there will be a lot coming in the later chapters.
