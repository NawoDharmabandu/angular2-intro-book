## Data Architecture

- Angular is flexible and doesn't prescribe a recipe for managing data in your apps
- Since observables are integrated into Angular, you can take advantage of observables to manage data and state
- You ca use services to manage streams that emit models
- Components can subscribe to the streams maintained by services and render accordingly.
    - For example, you can have a service for a Todo app that contains a stream of todos and a `ListComponent` can listen for todos and render when a new task is added.
    - You may have another component that listens for the user that has been assigned to a task provided by a service.
- The steps for creating different parts of an app can be summarized in three steps:
    - Defining a Model using a class
    - Defining the service
    - Defining the component
